# Web Master
Hello Everyone, <br>
As this repository is going to be the final live version of the website, you must all do the following: <br>
<ul>
<li>Push into this repository a file that contains all of the php files and javascript files you have created and are sourced and linked with one another</li>
<li>Make sure that all of your variables and core functions are named and organized through comments</li>
</ul>
If you are unfamiliar with php, you may choose to hand in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files instead. But they still need to be externally referenced. If you are unclear on how to do that, please contact me as soon as possible. <br><br>
This readme file will update constantly as more requirements come up, individual taskings will also be posted here.<br><br><br>
<p/>Leo Lou
